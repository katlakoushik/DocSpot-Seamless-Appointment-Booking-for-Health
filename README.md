SCENARIO-BASED CASE STUDY : 

1. USER REGISTRATION :

John, a patient in need of a routine check-up, downloads and opens the Book a Doctor App. He starts by registering as a customer, providing his email address and creating a password to ensure a secure login. Once the registration process is complete, John is welcomed to the app with the option to log in.

2. BROWSING DOCTORS :

After logging in, John is directed to a dashboard showcasing a list of doctors available for appointments. The app offers various filters for him to search for healthcare providers based on criteria such as specialty, location, and availability. John filters the list to find a family physician in his area, available for a routine check-up.

3. BOOKING AN APPOINTMENT :

John selects Dr. Smith, a family physician, and clicks the “Book Now” button. A booking form appears, prompting John to select his preferred appointment date and time. He is also asked to upload relevant documents, such as his medical records and insurance details. Once the form is completed, John submits the appointment request. He receives an immediate confirmation message indicating that his request is under review.

4. APPOINTMENT CONFIRMATION :

Dr. Smith, upon reviewing the request and his schedule, confirms the appointment. The status of John’s appointment changes to “Scheduled,” and John receives a notification with the appointment details—date, time, and location—via both email and SMS.

5. APPOINTMENT MANAGEMENT :

As the appointment date nears, John can access his booking history through the app’s dashboard. Here, he can manage upcoming appointments, cancel or reschedule them, and update their status. If needed, he can contact the doctor or the support team for assistance.

6. ADMIN APPROVAL (BACKGROUND PROCESS) :

In the background, the app’s admin is reviewing new doctor registrations. Dr. Smith, as a legitimate healthcare professional, is approved and added to the platform. The admin ensures that only verified doctors are listed, and the platform remains compliant with healthcare regulations and policies.

7. PLATFORM GOVERNANCE : 

The admin monitors the platform’s overall operation, addressing any issues, disputes, or system improvements. Ensuring the app’s compliance with privacy regulations and the terms of service is also a key responsibility, ensuring a smooth and secure experience for all users.

8. DOCTOR’S APPOINTMENT MANAGEMENT : 

On the day of the appointment, Dr. Smith logs into his dashboard and reviews his scheduled appointments. He sees John’s appointment and confirms the time. Throughout the day, Dr. Smith manages other appointments, updates their statuses, and ensures patients are attended to efficiently.

9. APPOINTMENT CONSULTATION : 

At the scheduled time, John visits Dr. Smith’s office. During the consultation, Dr. Smith provides medical care, performs the check-up, and gives advice on maintaining good health. John’s health concerns are addressed, and he feels assured that his routine check-up is complete.

10. POST-APPOINTMENT FOLLOW-UP : 

After the consultation, Dr. Smith updates John’s medical records within the app, noting any important observations, medications prescribed, or further treatments recommended. John receives a summary of his visit, including a prescription and any follow-up instructions via the app.

ER DIAGRAM : 




The Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram for the Book a Doctor app represents three key entities: Users, Doctors, and Appointments, with their respective attributes and relationships.

The Users collection holds basic user information, including _id, name, email, notification, password, isdoctor (to differentiate between patients and doctors), type, and phone. The isdoctor field identifies users who are doctors, while others are treated as patients or admins.

The Doctors collection stores information specific to doctors, such as their _id, userID (acting as a foreign key referencing the Users collection), fullname, email, timings, phone, address, specialisation, status, experience, and fees. The userID` links each doctor to their corresponding user account.

The Appointments collection stores details about appointments, including the _id, doctorInfo (foreign key referencing the Doctors collection), date, userInfo (foreign key referencing the Users collection), document (medical records or other files), and status (e.g., pending, confirmed). This collection maintains the relationship between users and doctors for each appointment.

The relationships are as follows: one User can be linked to one Doctor (one-to-one), a User can have multiple Appointments (one-to-many), and a Doctor can handle multiple Appointments (one-to-many). The foreign keys userID in the Doctors collection and doctorInfo and userInfo in the Appointments collection establish these connections, enabling the app to manage the interactions between patients and doctors effectively.
